Ydfs is a tool to build a linux distribution 

Features :

* Buildt from user account (no root or sudo needed)
* Fast boot
* Support x86, x86_64 (and maybe arm ARCH)
* applications must be buildt from source

== Install debootstrap for 32 bit release ==

You can build 32 and 64 bit on one computer

MY_CHROOT=/home/debian-jessie-32

install -d $MY_CHROOT
debootstrap --arch i386 jessie $MY_CHROOT http://http.debian.net/debian/
echo "proc $MY_CHROOT/proc proc defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount proc $MY_CHROOT/proc -t proc
echo "sysfs $MY_CHROOT/sys sysfs defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
mount sysfs $MY_CHROOT/sys -t sysfs
cp /etc/hosts $MY_CHROOT/etc/hosts
cp /proc/mounts $MY_CHROOT/etc/mtab
chroot $MY_CHROOT /bin/bash

== Build ydfs ==

To build ydfs ISO

Install packages

{{{
wget https://bitbucket.org/yourdistrofromscratch/ydfs/raw/master/2.5/configure
sh configure
}}}

Add user
{{{
useradd linuxconsole
mkdir /home/linuxconsole
chown linuxconsole /home/linuxconsole
}}}

Log in as user
{{{
su - linuxconsole
cd $HOME
install -d src
cd src
git clone https://bitbucket.org/yourdistrofromscratch/ydfs.git
cd ydfs
cd 2.5
make # it will take more thant 10 hours !
}}}

  * You can run ./configure as root to verify that all needed development tools are installed (optional)
  * Select arch to build
  * all packages form packages/list-$ARCH are downloaded then build
  * kernel is build
  * modules and iso are created
  * you can run "make test"

== Build Windows installer ==

{{{
bzr branch lp:wubi
cd wubi
wget https://bitbucket.org/yledoare/ydfs/raw/master/2.3/packages/patches/wubi5.diff
patch -p0 < wubi5.diff
cp $HOME/ydfs/src/2.3/logos/LinuxConsole.ico ./data/images/Wubi.ico
cp $HOME/ydfs/src/2.3/logos/LinuxConsole.ico ./data/images/
echo "Makes some changes into data/isolist.ini"
make
}}}

== Alternatives ==

See inside "config.ini" (written when selected ARCH)

You can :

  * Use crosstool-ng instead of host toolchain
  * build your own toolchain
  * enable MENUCONFIG=YES to select your kernel options

== Add locales ==

  * sudo vim /var/lib/locales/supported.d/local (ubuntu)
  * sudo vim /etc/locale.gen (debian)

Ex:

br_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8
de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
es_ES.UTF-8 UTF-8
fr_CA.UTF-8 UTF-8
fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8
pt_BR.UTF-8 UTF-8
ru_RU.UTF-8 UTF-8
zh_CN.UTF-8 UTF-8
cs_CZ.UTF-8 UTF-8
pl_PL.UTF-8 UTF-8

  * sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
  * or locale-gen

== Host Needed ==

  * Debian 8.3 (amd64,x86)

= Why Ydfs ? =

LinuxConsole 1.0 works quite fine, bus was designed in 2004 (then released in 2007,2008,2009,2010).

Ydfs has been written to build LinuxConsole 2.0. Full documentation should be written here before first announcement.

Lacks of LinuxConsole 1.0: 

  * Build modules updates is not enough simple.
  * Too much modules
  * Not enough communication
  * Only One developer
  * Linux Games are not popular like Windows ones
  * Low Community  

Good things :

  * One release every year
  * Easy install from windows
  * Home made configuration tool
  
= Ydfs Documentation =

The name "Ydfs" (means "choice" in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brezhoneg Brezhoneg]). With Ydfs, you could write your own distro, not only for x86, without be root, and for any desktop (lxde,gnome2,gnome3,KDE,...)  

Goals

  * Fast
  * Low disk space used (modules into squashfs/lzma)
  * Can Build from many systems (mageia, debian, scratch) 

Installs

  * On liveUSB (with unetbootlin)
  * On Hard disk (from Windows or liveUSB)

Boot

  * From initramfs
  * From Hard disk (to be faster) TODO

Targets

  * x86,x86_64,arm
